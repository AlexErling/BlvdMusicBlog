ThisIsTheSong is a music blog focusing on all sorts of electronic music. 


When finished the site will include posts with a tagging and responsive searching system. Additionally, the backend will include tiered posting system(admin and staff), where the admin can manage and run the entire site. After that we will consider what other features to add.

The backend api has been created with Ruby on Rails API and Active Admin.
The frontend is being built with Javascript using the React Framework.

We are hoping to get the site online as soon as possible to start sharing music with everyone.
